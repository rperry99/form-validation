**I want to make it clear that "signing up" does not do ANYTHING on this project. When you fill in the information and click submit, the information you entered is saved to an object then that object is displayed in the console. I am in no way saving any information here that you enter. If you want to test this project, feel free to use dummy information! I am not capturing anything**

## Thoughts

This was a really simple project. I didn't know that`input:valid` or `input:invalid` existed. It was a pretty easy way to add some basic form validation though HTML and CSS without needing JavaScript. I think form validation is a really useful thing to learn, and can be applied to so many different projects, whether it is a game website, portfolio contact form, or some kind of store. Form validation can be used in just about any project!
